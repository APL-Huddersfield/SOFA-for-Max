'SOFA For Max' is an object collection for using and creating Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics (SOFA) files within Cycling 74's Max software. This file format itself enables the distribution of impulse response measurement data in a standardised fashion. More information of this file format can be found [here](https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_(Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics)). Depending on the type of SOFA file used, these objects can be used in many ways, such as binaural audio reproduction and room acoustics simulation. Help files provided with the Max objects give tutorials and examples on how to use these objects.

## TODO

* Add write abilities to objects so SOFA files can be created in Max
* Fix shared object functionality
* ~~Create help files~~ Done!
* ~~Compile and release a windows version~~ Done!

## Usage

You can either use the existing objects in the 'Max Objects' folder, or download a ready built version of the object collection from the releases [page](https://github.com/APL-Huddersfield/SOFA-for-Max/releases) and place within your Max search path (e.g ./Max 7/Library/ ). If you wish, you can also build this repository from source.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Warning

The shared sofa~ object functionality is currently disabled. Only one instance of a named sofa~ file may currently exist. This feature will be fixed in future releases.

### Compatibility

The current version of the code and its associated release is compatible with both macOS and Windows.

### Prerequisites

This project requires a build of the **[libsofa](https://github.com/sofacoustics/API_Cpp)** library to be placed in the 'libraries' directory of this project, or in your library search path of your development environment.

### Installing

This source code can be built using either Xcode or Visual Studio. The resulting objects can then be placed in a location within your Max search path e.g. ~/Documents/Max 7/Library/SOFA

Windows Users: You will need to place some extra DLL files in your Max install folder. These are in the "Dependencies" folder of the latest release. Depending on the bit-ness you use, these should be placed in either "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cycling '74\Max" for 32-bit Max, or "C:\Program Files\Cycling '74\Max" for 64-bit Max.
