# SOFA for Max

An object collection for using and creating Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics (SOFA) files within Cycling 74's Max software. This file format enables the distribution of impulse response measurement data in a standardised fashion. More information of this file format can be found [here](https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_(Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics)).

## TODO

* Add sofa.poke~
* Fix shared object functionality
* ~~Create help files~~ Done!
* Compile and release a windows version

## Getting Started

You can either download a ready built version of the object collection from the releases page, or build this repository from source.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Warning

The shared sofa~ object functionality is currently disabled. Only one instance of a named sofa~ file may currently exist. This feature will be fixed in future releases.

### Compatibility

The current version of the code and its associated release is currently only compatible with macOS 10.11 and above. A Windows version is in development and will be available very soon.

### Prerequisites

This project requires a build of the **[libsofa](https://github.com/sofacoustics/API_Cpp)** library to be placed in the 'libraries' directory of this project, or in your library search path of your development environment.

### Installing

This source code can be built using either Xcode or Visual Studio. The resulting objects can then be placed in a location within your Max search path e.g. ~/Documents/Max 7/Library/SOFA
